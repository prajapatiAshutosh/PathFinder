# PathFinderr
An interactive web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms. Watch algorithms like Dijkstra's, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) come to life on a customizable grid.

‚ú® About The Project
Have you ever wondered how GPS navigation finds the quickest route or how enemies in a video game navigate the map? This project demystifies the process by providing a hands-on, visual tool to understand the core logic behind pathfinding.

This application allows you to:

Select an algorithm.

Create a "maze" by drawing walls on the grid.

Move the start and end points.

Launch the visualization and see how the algorithm explores the grid to find the shortest path.

It is built with pure JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks to keep it lightweight and focused on the core algorithmic logic.

üöÄ Features
Algorithm Selection: Choose between three fundamental pathfinding algorithms.

Interactive Grid: Click and drag to draw walls, creating custom mazes and obstacles.

Draggable Nodes: Easily move the Start üöÄ and End üéØ nodes to any open cell on the grid.

Adjustable Speed: Control the visualization speed to watch the process step-by-step or see the result quickly.

Customizable Grid Size: Change the grid dimensions for simpler or more complex scenarios.

Real-time Statistics: Get instant feedback on path length, nodes visited, and execution time.

Clear Controls: Easily clear the discovered path or reset the entire grid (including walls).

Responsive Design: Usable on a variety of screen sizes.
